## Greetings

Thanks for checkout out **LankyLocal**, my name is Kenny and I aim to be your one-stop shop for sharpening your arsenal. Whether they're critical tools you use everyday, special pieces that come out once per year, or priceless display items that hold a different kind of value in your day-to-day.

This website offers insights into the sharpening business, how to book services, maintaining edges between sharpening, and related sharpening theory which has kept my mind busy for years and needed a place to dump it all.

## What to expect

Whether your order is large or small, you'll get timely and quality results through my redundant methods to ensure optimal edge geometry, burr refinement, and consistent finish for every tool I touch. To better understand that process, feel free to check out the forthcoming *My Process* post on this site! For now, feel free to book directly [via email, text, or call](https://lankysharp.github.io/about/#contact). Reach out with any questions and I'll happily walk through any concerns or specific needs for your situation.

## Roadmap

As the saying goes, "you don't know, what you don't know". As if it's mandated by my midwestern upbringing, I must mention a bit about the things I know I must improve on before I can offer confident services to the repertoire. Electric hair clipper blades (human or pet, beard or mane), along with highly performant japanese-style convex shears require special equipment called a flat hone with jig system to correctly shape and profile the edges withing the .001" tolerances necessary for optimal performance. Even surgical tools require less concern about continuous polish along the entire primary bevel. Suffice to say, I hope to support these tools in the future, but for now must limit myself to flat-bevel grooming shears such as those pictured below.
