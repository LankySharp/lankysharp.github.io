## 24hr Turnaround Drop-Off Service

Simple, secure dropbox (and pick-up) access. I’ll provide clear instructions to my home drop location in Big Lake, MN. Fast turnaround keeps me warm in the winter and your tools back in action.

Just roll your tools in a hand towel or anything on hand and leave them for me to freshen up within a day!

## Mobile Sharpening

$100 minimum for mobile sharpening service and I'll drive to any metro area location.
(Example: 11 blades under 13" and a pair of kitchen shears)

I can supply my own power/workspace with just a small table setup outdoors and out of the way.
